<h1><center> THE PROCESS OF ATTAINING QUALITY SLEEP </center></h1>
<h3> So then let's start the process
First of all we need to program a scheme so we can alter the course of action and that will result in something i actually want to have... 
<p>So 1st thing will be the sleep
I actually don't have a quality sleep that I want i realised yesterday as it seemed that I woke up at middle of the night and when I woke up i didn't feel so good about it anyway, so now to have a quality sleep we need certain conditions to be met and they will be the things that cover the rest of the contents </p>
<p><left>One is that we need time but time alone can do nothing on its own , even when you have a lot of time like 7 to 8 hours without the deep quality sleep it won't be worth.. so let's try to get a quality sleep.. </left> </p>in this we have something like a mostly heard on that is to not have any screen time before bed and that is actually something i don't do even though I know I have to.. and let's just try and make it as a schedule... And the next thing will be something like a routine out of it that is to make it go on again and again and again like having the similar pattern same time to bed and wake up at same time at day by this routine it can be actually helpful to stick to the process..</h3>
